# üì± TO DO App ‚Ä¢ Flutter Tutorial ‚ô• Hive Local Storage

This is a simple yet powerful **TO DO App** built with **Flutter** that utilizes the **Hive local storage** for storing data locally on the device. The app follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, making the code structure modular and easy to maintain. Whether you're learning Flutter or looking for a practical solution to task management, this app covers the essentials.

## üéØ Features

- **Create a TO DO Tile**: Add new tasks with ease using an intuitive user interface.
- **Create a New Task**: Users can input and save tasks quickly.
- **Delete a Task**: Remove tasks from the list effortlessly.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are stored locally on the device using **Hive**, ensuring offline functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for creating beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile.
- **Hive**: A fast, lightweight, key-value database for Flutter apps that provides local storage functionality.
- **MVC Architecture**: The app follows the **Model-View-Controller** pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

## üìù MVC Architecture

The app is structured using the **MVC** pattern:

- **Model**: Defines the structure of the data (task) and handles the Hive storage.
- **View**: Contains the UI components like task tiles and input fields.
- **Controller**: Manages the logic of adding, deleting, and retrieving tasks from Hive.

This structure makes the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend.
